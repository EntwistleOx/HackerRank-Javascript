// Brute force solves this problem, but we can do better (we can solve a_i <= 10^9)
// First find the LCM of array A, the GCD of B, then we can simply check how many divisors are there in GCD_B/LCM_A.
// In case B%A != 0, output 0.
// How to count the number of divisors of a number? We can factorize a number into primes:
// X = p_1^r_1 * p_2^r_2 * ... * p_n^r_n
// Then the number of divisors is simply (r_1 + 1) * (r_2 + 1) * ... * (r_n + 1). (1 and X inclusive)
// However I'm too lazy to implement this :-) Just brute force here.

// The integers that are between A and B are 4, 8, and 16.Though this problem can be solved with brute-force, there is a nice fast solution.
// – x is divisible by all numbers of A if and only if it is divisible by their least common multiple. Denote it as l.
// – All numbers of B are divisible by x if and only if the greatest common divisor of all numbers of B is divisible by B. Denote it as r.
// – Now we have to find the number of x such that r is divisible by x and x is divisible by l. If r is not divisible by l, no such x exists. 
// Otherwise, we can divide r, x, and l by l. Now it’s just the number of divisors of (r/l) which can be found in Sqrt(c) time or even faster, 
// where C is the maximum number of the sets.
